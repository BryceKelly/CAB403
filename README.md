# CAB403
CAB403 assignment

Gotta learn to use git, seems like a good place to start. Shame this is public but meh, nobody who is worse than me at 403 is gonna see it.

Right now I can connect multiple clients and I have the lines from the files stored although I still need to tokenise or whatever to strip the white text.
